Qst.1: In the course of doing this task, I studied/learned/did: 
How to define and use "f" functions, 
How to specify the type of input (using the in-built function) i want to have, call functions with proper indentation.
The task covers creating a function that checks users height (in centimeters), and returnig a response when they enter their Height.
I also attempted to do an extra work..

Qst.2: In the course of doing this task, I studied/learned/did: 
How to convert strings of many lines and words into small letters, for accurate counting of both uppercase and lowercase letters, 
Learnt how to count specific letter(s), 
On python strings formatting, with the "F-string" function,
Learnt how to enter strings of many lines accurately without errors using the "triple quotation" instead of the single quotation for one line.

Qst.3: In the course of doing this task, I studied/learned/did:
On python while loops, indentations, 
Used the modulo operation to check remainders, of dividends/divisors.

Qst.4: In the course of doing this task, I studied/learned/did:
On python "AND", "OR" logical statements,
used them to combine conditions.

Qst.5/6: In the course of doing this task, I studied/learned/did:
On python lists, list sorting, 
Initializing lists, and Storing of entered values into list, using the "empty square bracket".
Used the ".append" function to add enteries to initialized list,
Used the min and max command to determine which age is highest or lowest.

Qst.7: In the course of doing this task, I studied/learned/did:
On python range functions,
Used it to define ranges of natural numbers,
Lastly, obtained their sum

Qst.8: In the course of doing this task, I studied/learned/did:
On python range functions,
Used the syntax "range(start, stop, step)" to obtain my even numbers.
used 2, as a start, used a step of 2 as my count, and 21 as my last range point.
Used it to define ranges of even numbers,
Lastly, obtained their sum.
